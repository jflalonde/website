Welcome! I am a Full professor in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](http://www.gelgif.ulaval.ca) at [Université Laval](http://www.ulaval.ca), specializing in computer vision. Since 2022, I am also the associate scientific director of the [IID (Institute Intelligence and Data)](https://iid.ulaval.ca). I grew up in Québec City, Canada, lived almost 10 years in the States and have been back in [this beautiful city](http://www.quebecregion.com/en) since 2013.

I obtained my Ph.D. in 2011 from the [Robotics Institute](http://www.ri.cmu.edu), in the [School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu), where I was advised by [Alyosha Efros](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/) and [Srinivas Narasimhan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~srinivas). I then spent a year as a Computer Vision Scientist at [Tandent, Inc.](http://www.tandent.com), followed by another year as a Post-Doc at [Disney Research](http://www.disneyresearch.com), Pittsburgh. 

I do research in computer vision, machine learning, AR and VR. In particular, I am interested in exploring how physics-based models and data-driven machine learning techniques can be combined to better understand, model, interpret, and recreate the richness of our visual world. See [here for a more "official" bio](bio).

I've been fortunate to count [this amazing group of people as my students](students). My group has captured some of the largest datasets of HDR illumination, both indoors and outdoors, freely available to academic researchers. [Get them here](http://www.hdrdb.com).
